        Potato park established to conserve reigon's potato diversity<br>
        the goal is to develop potato varieties that can grow in warmer climates<br>
        410 varieties have been reintroduced<br>
        1345 varieties are now being grown which increases food security</p>

          these are artificial glaciers that will supply water to villages in Ladakh.<br>
          when they melt in spring, it provides water for local villages and helps irrigate farms
